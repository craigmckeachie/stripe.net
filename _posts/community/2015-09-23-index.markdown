##**Donations**

If you would like to donate to help support stripe.net, my paypal address is jaymedavis@gmail.com. It's certainly not required, but I would appreciate it. :)


##**Contributions** 
**If you would like to submit a pull request.**

First, thank you! It is a lot of work to learn someone else's codebase, so I appreciate it. Here are a few things that would help me out:
* Do not submit pull requests for more than one fix. Keep them small and focused.
* Please code review yourself. There are a lot of pull requests with typos and mistakes. Don't worry, we all do it. But a code review of yourself will help. :)
* Please review the diff in GitHub that I will see before I merge your pull requests. If it's hard for you to tell what the differences are, it's going to be hard for me too.
